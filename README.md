# -Road-Lane-Line---Detection-System
# Road Lane Line Detection System

## Overview

The Road Lane Line Detection System is designed to identify and track lane lines on roadways using computer vision techniques. This system can be used for applications such as lane-keeping assist systems in autonomous vehicles or for traffic analysis and monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time lane line detection.
- Handles different road conditions and lane markings.
- Compatible with various video sources (camera feeds, video files).
- Provides visual feedback and overlays on the detected lane lines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- scikit-image (for additional image processing functionalities)

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Road-Lane-Line-Detection-System.git
cd Road-Lane-Line-Detection-System
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Command Line
You can run the lane detection system from the command line:

bash
Copy code
python lane_detection.py --input <path_to_video_or_camera_index> --output <path_to_output_video>
--input: Path to the input video file or camera index (0 for the default camera).
--output: Path to save the output video with detected lane lines.
Example
bash
Copy code
python lane_detection.py --input video.mp4 --output output_video.mp4
Script Overview
lane_detection.py: The main script to run the lane detection algorithm. Includes functionality for reading video files or live camera feeds, processing each frame to detect lane lines, and saving or displaying the output.
How It Works
Capture Video Feed: The system captures video input from a file or camera.
Preprocessing: Apply filters and transformations to enhance lane line visibility.
Lane Detection: Use image processing techniques to detect and highlight lane lines.
Overlay Results: Draw detected lane lines on the video frames.
Display/Save Output: Show the processed video with lane lines or save it to a file.
Code Structure
lane_detection.py: Main script for lane line detection.
utils.py: Helper functions for image processing and visualization.
